        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            Not a lot of notes this week. Most time was spend making the portfolio page.
            One thing that stuck out to me during the reading that I never knew about but 
            probably should have is that when calling a function from HTML you can pass in 'this'
            So that the calling function has information about what is calling the function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also learned to love the Dark Slate Blue color, which is what I used on the navbar.
