        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>A lot of my time this week has been spent on coming up with ideas for my last milestone along with starting it!</p>
        <h3>Stuff that needs to happen when making change</h3>
        <p>A potential list of tasks that could need to happen everytime something changes is this:

            Lint CSS and Javascript to find any coding issues.
            Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last changes
            compile all SCSS/LESS to CSS
            concatinate all CSS into one file for faster loading,
            Minify the CSS to reduce file size.
            Transpile Javascript with Babel for wider support for older browsers
            Concatinate all JS files into one file for faster loading
            Minify and Uglify Javascript to reduce size
            Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS
            Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to separate them from the development stuff
            Whew! That's a big list...and they have to happen A LOT!</p>
